Portfolio Project: Bank Loan Report 

I am excited to share a comprehensive Bank Loan Report project that I recently completed using SQL Server Management Studio and Excel. This project involved analyzing and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to gain insights into loan applications and their statuses.

Key Insights:
1. Total Loan Applications
2. Month-on-Month Applications
3. Total Funded Amount
4. Total Amount Received
5. Average Interest Rate
6. Average Debt to Income (DTI)

Good Loan Analysis: Good Loan Application Percentage, Good Loan Funded Amount, Good Loan Received Amount
Bad Loan Analysis: Bad Loan Application Percentage, Bad Loan Funded Amount, Bad Loan Received Amount

Additional Insights:
Loan Status, Monthly Trends, Regional Analysis, Loan Term Analysis, Home Ownership Analysis, Employee Length Analysis, Loan Purpose Breakdown
